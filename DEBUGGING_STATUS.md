# Authentication System Debugging Status
Last Updated: December 30, 2024

## Current State
The application is implementing friend discovery and management functionality. Basic authentication and profile management are working, and we're currently debugging friend request system implementation.

## Active Issues

### 1. Friend Request System Implementation
Currently fixing an issue with the friend request system:
- Friend suggestions page is implemented
- Friend request model and routes are created
- UI error when clicking "Connect" button has been fixed
- Need to verify friend request functionality is working

#### Server-side Status
- FriendRequest model created with proper relationships
- Routes implemented for:
  - Sending friend requests
  - Viewing pending requests
  - Accepting/declining requests
- Database tables created for friend connections

#### Client-side Implementation
- Friend suggestions template updated to use correct form submission
- Friend requests page template created
- UI components styled with Bootstrap dark theme

### 2. Database Schema Updates
Recent changes include:
- Added FriendRequest model
- Created friend_connection table for many-to-many relationships
- Existing User model updated with friend relationships

## Steps Taken
1. Implemented FriendRequest model with proper relationships
2. Added new routes for friend request management
3. Created templates for friend suggestions and requests
4. Fixed form submission in friend suggestions template
5. Added proper error handling for friend requests
6. Implemented friend connection functionality

## Current Implementation

### Friend Management Flow
1. User views friend suggestions based on matching algorithm
2. Can send friend request through "Connect" button
3. Recipient can view pending requests
4. Options to accept or decline requests
5. Accepted requests create bilateral friendship connection

### Relevant Files
- `models.py`: Contains FriendRequest and friend relationship models
- `app.py`: Friend request routes and handling
- `templates/friend_suggestions.html`: Updated UI for sending requests
- `templates/friend_requests.html`: UI for managing received requests

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

2. Test accept/decline request flow
3. Implement friend list view and management
4. Add notification system for friend requests
5. Enhance friend suggestion algorithm
6. Add request status indicators
7. Implement friend removal functionality

## Current Environment
- Flask development server running on port 5001
- PostgreSQL database configured with updated schema
- Bootstrap 5.3.0 dark theme
- Debug logging enabled

## Notes for Next Session
- The friend request form submission has been fixed
- Need to test complete friend request flow
- Consider adding email notifications for friend requests
- Verify proper error handling for edge cases
- Consider adding request expiry functionality
- Test friend suggestion scoring algorithm
