# Authentication System Debugging Status
Last Updated: December 30, 2024

## Current State
The application is a Flask-based social networking platform with two-factor authentication using email OTP. The basic authentication flow is implemented, but we're currently debugging an issue with the OTP modal display and server port configuration.

## Active Issues

### 1. OTP Modal Display
The OTP modal is not appearing after successful login credentials verification, despite receiving a successful response from the server.

#### Server-side Status
- Login endpoint (`/login`) is working correctly
- OTP generation and email sending are functioning
- Server returns correct JSON response: `{"message": "OTP sent successfully", "success": true}`
- OTP verification endpoint (`/verify-otp`) is implemented and ready

#### Client-side Issue
The Bootstrap modal for OTP entry is not displaying after successful login, despite:
- Receiving correct server response
- No visible JavaScript errors
- Modal HTML being present in the DOM
- Bootstrap JS being properly loaded

### 2. Server Configuration
- Currently implementing dynamic port allocation (5000-5010 range)
- Server automatically finds the next available port if default port is in use
- Logging has been added to track port allocation
- Environment is configured for development with debug mode enabled

## Steps Taken
1. Verified server-side OTP generation and email sending works
2. Added extensive console logging to track modal initialization
3. Simplified modal HTML structure
4. Moved Bootstrap modal initialization after DOM load
5. Added verification checks for modal element existence
6. Added debug logging throughout the authentication flow
7. Implemented dynamic port allocation to handle port conflicts

## Current Implementation

### Login Flow
1. User submits login form with credentials
2. Server verifies credentials
3. If valid, generates OTP and sends email
4. Returns JSON response
5. Client should show modal for OTP entry (currently failing)
6. After OTP verification, redirects to profile

### Relevant Files
- `templates/login.html`: Contains modal implementation and JS
- `app.py`: Handles login and OTP verification
- `models.py`: User model with OTP methods
- `main.py`: Server configuration and port management

## Next Debug Steps to Try
1. Verify Bootstrap JS loading order:
   - Ensure Bootstrap JS loads before modal initialization
   - Consider moving script to head with defer attribute

2. Alternative Modal Implementation:
   - Try using jQuery to show modal
   - Test with vanilla JS implementation
   - Consider using Bootstrap's data attributes approach

3. Event Handling:
   - Add event listeners for modal events
   - Log modal show/hide events
   - Verify event propagation

4. DOM Structure:
   - Verify modal placement in DOM
   - Check for potential CSS conflicts
   - Ensure no other elements interfere with modal display

## Current Environment
- Flask development server running with dynamic port allocation (5000-5010 range)
- PostgreSQL database configured and working
- Email sending functionality working (using Flask-Mail)
- Bootstrap 5.3.0 loaded from CDN
- Debug logging enabled for server and client-side operations

## Related Issue History
- Previous error: DataError with reset token length (fixed)
- Current error: UI/JavaScript issue with modal display
- New consideration: Server port allocation handling

## Notes for Next Developer
- The server-side implementation is working correctly
- Focus debugging efforts on client-side modal implementation
- Console logs have been added throughout the authentication flow
- Bootstrap modal initialization might need restructuring
- Dynamic port allocation has been implemented to handle port conflicts
- Review logs in browser console and server output for detailed debugging information
